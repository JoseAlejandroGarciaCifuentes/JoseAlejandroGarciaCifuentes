<h2>The Path of The Unseen</h2>
<p>The Path Of The Unseen is the project I have been working on these last weeks. 
  <br>This game is about understanding the difficulties some people with mental disorders go through. This is just a demo and in no case represents the reality of them, this just shows some particularities as in a horror game. Hope you enjoy it, I will leave the download link down below.<p>
