  I have been around computers for as long as I can remember, that is the reason my life has brought me into this area. Also, I have spent most of my time learning by myself so I could consider myself as a self taught dev, something that has helped me a lot in learning new languages or interfaces quicker than the average. I am always willing to help and excited about learning new features so I can get to know every bit of it!
